2. Use the "git add ." command to add all the changes made
3. Use the "git commit -m "<your custom message>"" to commit the changes and prepare them for pushing
4. Use the "git push" to send the updates in your local repository to your remote branch(the github website branch)

NOTE : Commits made must contain complete tasks.

3.  On this page, click on the "base" option (default is main) and select develop branch as the base branch. Then click on the "compare" option and select the branch you worked on. (These actions basically tell github to compare your branch to the develop branch, and put all the changes into the develop branch).
