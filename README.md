1. Use the "git status" command in the terminal to check for changes that have been made in your local repository
2. Use the "git add ." command to add all the changes made
3. Use the "git commit -m "<your custom message>"" to commit the changes and prepare them for pushing
4. Use the "git push" to send the updates in your local repository to your remote branch(the github website branch)

NOTE : Commits made must contain complete tasks.
          
CREATING A PULL REQUEST
          
After your remote branch has been updated, you'll need to create a pull request to the "develop branch". This is basically you asking for your codes to be added to the branch that's incharge of receiving all the other branch codes.
 
 1. Click on the "Pull Requests" option at the top of the github repository page
          
 2. There should be a "New Pull Request" option at the right side of the screen. Clicking on it will take you to a "Compare Changes" page
          
 3. On this page, click on the "base" option (default is main) and select develop branch as the base branch. Then click on the "compare" option and select the branch you worked on. (These actions basically tell github to compare your branch to the develop branch, and put all the changes into the develop branch).
          
 4. Click on the "Create Pull Request". This will take you to the "Open a Pull Request" page.
          
 5. In the field available for comments, you'll be required to post 3 screenshots. A screenshot of your webpage on; desktop view, tablet view, and mobile view. Contact the project administrator for tips on how to take the screenshots, if need be.
          
 6. After all the files have been uploaded, you can go ahead and create the pull request.
